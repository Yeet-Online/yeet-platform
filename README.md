# Getting Started
This is the backend/platform side of yeet-online. For the front end go to [yeet-client](https://github.com/Yeet-Online/yeet-client).

## Step 1: Cloning the repo
You're going to want to clone this repo. If you're starting with this repository, you might want to clone [yeet-client](https://github.com/Yeet-Online/yeet-client) in the same directory (you'll see why later).

## Step 2: Starting up the app
All you have to do to get the platform running is cd into your platform directory and then run th following command:

```aidl
./gradlew bootRun
```

That will install all the dependencies and start the platform. Super simple, like it should be.

## Using Swagger

If you wanted to use the api directly via swagger, first run it locally (see above steps) then go here in your browser: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/#/](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/#/)
